The safe way (i tested it). First connect to 3.3V USB-TTL output first (also 5V Mini can work with 3.3V). Now prepare this sketch:

void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(10000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(10000);
}

Choose "Arduino Pro/Mini" with 5v/16MHz board and upload sketch.
If you see that the blinking is correct (10 sec ON/10sec OFF) - you have 5V/16MHz Arduino.
Otherwise it will blink at 5 sec intervals instead of 10 sec.
